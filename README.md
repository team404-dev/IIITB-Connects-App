# IIITB Connects

## Introduction
This lets you connect efficiently with your college mates, enquire your queries, help your colleagues through their problems, and build your connections.<br>
We already have an android project that can be downloaded from this [link][LINK]. Also to get the idea of what we actually intend to dok can be found on the [official site][IIITB]. Earlier the project was on Native Android - Java. This time for learning purpose we are trying to switch it to Flutter.

## To-do
You can keep a track over issues, where we will be posting, what needs to be done, there you can show your interest and we can assign you work. This is just a basic starter project.
